            <h2>The Conference</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the home page of the 23rd ACM
                International Conference on Hybrid Systems:
                Computation and Control (HSCC 2020). HSCC 2020 is
                the 23rd in a <a href="http://www.hscc-conference.org/">series of
                    conferences</a> on all aspects of hybrid systems.
                It is dedicated to advancing design and analysis
                techniques that bridge control theory and computer
                science, and is expanding to new domains in
                security and privacy and in systems biology. The
                conference covers the range from theoretical
                results to practical applications and experiences
                in cyber-physical systems (CPS), mixed signal
                circuits, robotics, infrastructure networks, and
                biological models.
                <p>HSCC 2020 will be part of the thirteenth <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cpsiot/cpsweek2020/index.html">Cyber
                    Physical Systems Week (CPS Week)</a>, and co-located
                    with the International Conference on
                    Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), Information
                    Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), the
                    Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications
                    Symposium (RTAS), Conference on Internet-of-Things
                    Design and Implementation (IOTDI), and related
                    workshops.

            <h3>Reproducability and Repeatability</h3>
            <p>
                We consider reproducibility and repeatability of the
                results presented in the tool/case study papers an
                important aspect of such papers. While submission of a
                repeatability evaluation package is not mandatory, we
                strongly encourage the authors to submit such a
                package at the time of paper submission. Tool or case
                study papers with a repeatability evaluation package
                will be judged on the merit of both the paper itself,
                but also on the repeatability of the presented
                results. Tool/Case study papers not accompanied by a
                RE package would be judged on the strength of the
                benchmarks (e.g. large-scale industrial/proprietary
                benchmarks), or the role of the tool as a component in
                a complex tool-chain ecosystem. Instructions on
                preparing and submitting the repeatability evaluation
                package can be found <a href="re.html">here</a>.

                    <strong> Note for tool/case study paper authors on
                    double-blind process:</strong> While we expect the
                tool/case study papers submitted to the main
                conference to follow the double-blind instructions,
                the RE packages do not need to be
                anonymized. Therefore please remove any links to a
                repository that could reveal your identity from the
                paper but include these in your RE package
                submission. RE packages and papers will be evaluated
                by different committees. RE committee's findings will
                be communicated to the regular reviewers of the paper
                before the final decisions are made.

            <h2>Poster/Demo Session and Submission Information</h2>
            <p>
                Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC) 2020 is
                the 23rd in a series of conferences focusing on
                original research on concepts, tools, and techniques
                from computer science, control theory, and applied
                mathematics for the analysis and control of hybrid
                dynamical systems with an emphasis on computational
                aspects. By drawing on strategies from computation and
                control, the hybrid systems field offers techniques
                that are applicable to both man-made cyber-physical
                systems (ranging from small robots to global
                infrastructure networks) and natural systems (ranging
                from biochemical networks to physiological
                models). Posters and demos in the conference are
                expected to range over a wide spectrum of topics from
                theoretical results to practical considerations, and
                from academic research to industrial adoption. Posters
                and demos covering design automation, tools, and
                benchmarks are especially welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                Posters presented at the conference will provide an
                opportunity for conference attendees to interact with
                researchers in an informal setting. Posters may be
                about already accepted papers, ongoing research
                projects, discussions on new problem statements, or
                preview of late-breaking results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Demos will give the audience a closer look at tools
                and techniques, and offer an interactive experience
                with the demonstrated entities. The selection criteria
                for acceptance will be: novelty, technical merit,
                relevance to HSCC and, especially for demos, details
                on the presentation. If desired and not previously
                published, abstracts up to 2 page in length describing
                the poster or demo will be included for publication in
                the electronic proceedings of HSCC.
            </p>
            <p>
                These sessions are an excellent way to exchange ideas
                and for presenters to obtain feedback from the
                attendees. A Best Poster/Demo prize will be awarded
                and announced during the conference and on the
                website.
            </p>

                from computer science, control theory, and applied
                mathematics for the analysis and control of hybrid
                dynamical systems with an emphasis on computational
                aspects. By drawing on strategies from computation and
                control, the hybrid systems field offers techniques
                that are applicable to both man-made cyber-physical
                systems (ranging from small robots to global
                infrastructure networks) and natural systems (ranging
                from biochemical networks to physiological
                models). Papers in the conference are expected to
                range over a wide spectrum of topics from theoretical
                results to practical considerations, and from academic
                research to industrial adoption.

            <h4>Special tracks</h4>
            <p>This year, HSCC will have three special tracks on
                interdisciplinary topics of increasing interest and
                importance to CPS: (1) Artificial Intelligence and
                Machine Learning in CPS (autonomous and
                semi-autonomous CPS, learning-based CPS, deep
                learning, intersection of robotics/AI and CPS, etc.),
                and (2) Design Automation for CPS (modeling,
                specification, verification, synthesis, composition,
                hierarchy, languages, etc. for CPS design). (3)
                Autonomy and Robotics. The submission requirements and
                review process for special track papers will be the
                same as regular papers. The main reason to have a
                special track is to broaden the HSCC pool of papers in
                the direction of these topics. </p>
