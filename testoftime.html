        <h1>Call for Nominations for HSCC Test-Of-Time Award:</h1>

        <p>Coming Soon</p>

        <!-- 
        <br>

        We would like to solicit nominations for the “HSCC Test-of-Time Award” to recognize the work
        published at a Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC) conference in 2009 or before, which has proven to be the most visionary and impactful, leading to new directions of research being initiated, or new applications being brought into the hybrid systems research community. The award selection is through a committee of three internationally well-known and outstanding scientists who significantly contributed to the hybrid systems field and also to the HSCC organization. Choosing the eventual awardee is at the sole discretion of the selection committee, that will carefully consider the nominated papers.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span style="font-weight:bold">Deadline for nominating papers for the award:</span> December 21, 2018, 11:59 pm UTC-12.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span style="font-weight:bold">Background:</span> The HSCC conference series founded in a meeting in Grenoble after the HART’97 workshop, was a convergence of two trends. On one hand, at the end of the 80s, researchers in formal verification of discrete systems were exploring timed systems represented by additional clock variables, and then started branching into systems with more complex continuous dynamics as in hybrid systems. On the other hand, researchers in control were interested in using such models and verification techniques to analyze control systems that fall outside the traditional control system models, capturing the essence of real implemented control systems. The first hybrid systems workshop took place in Berkeley in 1998.

        This award was initiated at the 20th anniversary of HSCC in 2018 to reflect on the papers published at HSCC that have had the most impact on the larger computer science and control theory/practice community.

        <br>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Eligibility Rules:</span>
        <ul>
            <li> The paper should have been published at an HSCC conference, in 2009 or before.

                <li> The paper cannot be co-authored by any person on the selection committee.
        </ul>

        <br>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Nomination Rules and Procedure:</span>
        <br>
        You cannot nominate papers for which you are a co-author.

        To nominate a paper, you should send an email to the HSCC 2019 PC chairs Necmiye Ozay and
        Pavithra Prabhakar at <span style="color: #1583E8;"><a href="mailto:hscc19@easychair.org">hscc19@easychair.org</a></span>
        containing the following pieces of information (approximately 500 words overall):

        <ul>
            <li> The title of the paper, the full list of authors, and the year of publication.

                <li> A paragraph describing the larger context in which the work is of relevance, and explaining the importance of the work to the community.

                    <li> A second paragraph indicating the strength of the technical or experimental results, and providing some quantifiable metrics (such as number of citations as measured by Google Scholar) as a measure of the impact of the paper. Subjective evidence of the impact is also accepted.
        </ul>


        <br>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Selection Committee:</span>
        <br>
