        <h1>HSCC Test-Of-Time Award</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Call for Nominations</h2>
            <p> HSCC 2020 organizers are soliciting nominations for the
                HSCC Test-of-Time Award to recognize the work published at a Hybrid
                Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC) conference in 2010 or before,
                which has proven to be the most visionary and impactful, leading to
                new directions of research being initiated, or new applications being
                brought into the hybrid systems research community. The award
                selection is through a committee of three internationally well-known
                and outstanding scientists who significantly contributed to the hybrid
                systems field and also to the HSCC organization. Choosing the eventual
                awardee is at the sole discretion of the selection committee, that
                will carefully consider the nominated papers.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The HSCC conference series founded in a meeting in
                Grenoble after the HART’97 workshop, was a convergence of
                two trends. On one hand, at the end of the 80s,
                researchers in formal verification of discrete systems
                were exploring timed systems represented by additional
                clock variables, and then started branching into systems
                with more complex continuous dynamics as in hybrid
                systems. On the other hand, researchers in control were
                interested in using such models and verification
                techniques to analyze control systems that fall outside
                the traditional control system models, capturing the
                essence of real implemented control systems. The first
                hybrid systems workshop took place in Berkeley in 1998.

                This award was initiated at the 20th anniversary of HSCC in
                2018 to reflect on the papers published at HSCC that have had
                the most impact on the larger computer science and control
                theory/practice community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nominators cannot nominate papers on which they are a
                co-author. To nominate a paper, please should send an
                email to the HSCC 2020 Awards Chair
                at <a href="mailto:oishi@unm.edu">oishi@unm.edu</a>
                containing the following pieces of
                information (approximately 500 words overall):
            </p>
