            <details>
                <summary><strong>Abstract:</strong></summary>
                
                <blockquote>
                    Deep learning has been extremely successful in
                    computer vision and perception.  Inspired by this
                    success in perceiving environments, deep learning is
                    now one of the main sensing modalities in autonomous
                    robots, including driverless cars.  The recent success
                    of deep reinforcement learning in chess or AlphaGo
                    suggests that robot planning control will soon be
                    performed by deep learning in a model free manner,
                    disrupting traditional model-based engineering design.
                    However, recent crashes in driverless cars as well as
                    adversarial attacks in deep networks have exposed the
                    brittleness of deep learning perception which then
                    leads to catastrophic decisions.  There is a
                    tremendous opportunity for the cyber physical systems
                    community to embrace these challenges and develop
                    principles, architectures, and tools to ensure safety
                    of autonomous systems.
                </br></br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this talk, I will present our
                approach in ensuring the robustness and safety of
                autonomous robots that use deep learning as a
                perceptual sensor in the feedback loop. Using ideas
                from robust control, we develop tools to analyze the
                robustness of deep networks that ensure that the
                perception of the environment is more
                accurate. Critical to our approach is creating
                semantic representations of unknown environments while
                also quantifying the uncertainty of semantic
                maps. Autonomous planning and control need to both
                embrace such semantic representations and formally
                reason about the environment uncertainty produced by
                deep learning the feedback loop, leading to autonomous
                robots that operate with prescribed safely in unknown
                but learned environments.

                <blockquote>
                    Machine learning and control theory have made substantial advances in
                    the field of cyber-physical systems and robotics in the past
                    decade. However, there are still many challenges remaining when
                    studying cyber-physical systems that interact with humans, i.e.,
                    human-CPS. This includes autonomous vehicles that interact with
                    people, service robots working with their users at homes, assistive
                    robots helping disabled bodies, or humans interacting with drones or
                    other autonomous agents in their daily lives. These challenges
                    introduce an opportunity for developing new learning and control
                    algorithms to enable safe and efficient interactive autonomy.
                </br></br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this talk, I will discuss a
                journey in formalizing human-CPS
                interaction. Specifically, I will first discuss
                developing data-efficient techniques to learn
                computational models of human behavior. I will
                continue with the challenges that arise when agents
                (including humans and robots) interact with each
                other. Further, I will argue that in many
                applications, a full computational human model is not
                necessary for seamless and efficient
                interaction. Instead, in many collaborative tasks,
                conventions —low-dimensional shared representations of
                tasks — is sufficient for capturing the interaction
                between agents. I will conclude the talk with
                challenges around adapting conventions in human-robot
                applications such as assistive teleoperation and
                collaborative transport.

                  <p>Reachability analysis, in general, is a fundamental method that supports formally-correct
                     synthesis, robust model predictive control, set-based observers, fault detection,
                     invariant computation, and conformance checking, to name but a few. In many of these
                     applications, one requires to compute a reachable set starting within a previously
                     computed reachable set. While it was previously required to re-compute the entire
                     reachable set, we demonstrate that one can leverage the dependencies of states within
                     the previously computed set. As a result, we almost instantly obtain an over-approximative
                     subset of a previously computed reachable set by evaluating analytical maps. The advantages
                     of our novel method are demonstrated for falsification of systems, optimization over
                     reachable sets, and synthesizing safe maneuver automata. In all of these applications,
                     the computation time is reduced significantly.

                  <p>Reachability analysis is one of the most important methods for formal verification
                     of hybrid systems. The main difficulty for hybrid system reachability analysis is
                     to calculate the intersection between reachable set and guard sets. While there exist
                     several approaches for guard sets defined by hyperplanes or polytopes, only few methods
                     are able to handle nonlinear guard sets. In this work we present a novel approach
                     to tightly enclose the intersections of reachable sets with nonlinear guard sets.
                     One major advantage of our method is its polynomial complexity with respect to the
                     system dimension, which makes it applicable for high-dimensional systems. Furthermore,
                     our approach can be combined with different reachability algorithms for continuous
                     systems due to its modular design. We demonstrate the advantages of our novel approach
                     compared to existing methods with numerical examples.

                  <p>Hybrid automata are an emerging formalism used to model sampled-data control Cyber-Physical
                     Systems (CPS), and analyze their behavior using reachability analysis. This is because
                     hybrid automata provide a richer and more flexible modeling framework, compared to
                     traditional approaches. However, modern state-of-the-art tools struggle to analyze
                     such systems, due to the computational complexity of the reachability algorithm, and
                     due to the introduced overapproximation error. These shortcomings are largely attributed
                     (but not limited) to the aggregation of sets.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In this paper we propose a subspace identification approach for decomposed aggregation
                     in the reachability analysis of hybrid automata with linear dynamics. Our key contribution
                     is the observation that the choice of a good subspace basis does not only depend on
                     the sets being aggregated, but also on the continuous-time dynamics of an automaton.
                     With this observation in mind, we present a dynamics-aware sub-space identification
                     algorithm that we use to construct tight decomposed convex hulls for the aggregated
                     sets.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Our approach is evaluated on two practically relevant hybrid automata models of sampled-data
                     CPS that have been shown to be difficult to analyze by modern state-of-the-art tools.
                     Specifically, we show that for these models our approach can improve the accuracy
                     of the reachable set by up-to 10 times when compared to standard Principal Component
                     Analysis (PCA), for which finding a fixed point is not guaranteed. We also show that
                     while the computational complexity is increased, a fixed-point is found earlier.

                  <p>We introduce and study the concept of worst-case topological entropy of switched linear
                     systems under arbitrary switching. It is shown that this quantity is equal to the
                     minimal data rate (number of bits per second) required for the state observation of
                     the switched linear system with any switching signal. A computable closed-form expression
                     is presented for the worst-case topological entropy of switched linear systems. Finally,
                     a practical coder-decoder, operating at a data rate arbitrarily close to the worst-case
                     topological entropy, is described.

                  <p>Our problem is to compute trajectories of a hybrid system that switches between stable
                     affine ODEs, with switching triggered by hyperplane crossings. Instead of integrating
                     over relatively short time steps, we propose to analytically calculate the affine
                     ODE trajectories between switching times. Our algorithm computes the switching times
                     themselves by Chebyshev interpolation of the analytic trajectory pieces, and polynomial
                     root finding. We shrink the interpolation time intervals using bounds on the times
                     needed by the affine ODE trajectories to enter certain Lyapunov sub-level sets. Based
                     on the Chebfun package, we give a MATLAB implementation of our algorithm. We find
                     that this implementation simulates Relay feedback systems as accurately and sometimes
                     faster than conventional algorithms.

                  <p>In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically designing a Rectified Linear
                     Unit (ReLU) Neural Network (NN) architecture that is sufficient to implement the optimal
                     Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for an LTI system with quadratic cost. Specifically,
                     we propose AReN, an algorithm to generate Assured ReLU Architectures. AReN takes as
                     input an LTI system with quadratic cost specification, and outputs a ReLU NN architecture
                     with the assurance that there exist network weights that exactly implement the associated
                     MPC controller. AReN thus offers new insight into the design of ReLU NN architectures
                     for the control of LTI systems: instead of training a heuristically chosen NN architecture
                     on data - or iterating over many architectures until a suitable one is found - AReN
                     can suggest an adequate NN architecture before training begins. While several previous
                     works were inspired by the fact that ReLU NN controllers and optimal MPC controllers
                     are both Continuous, Piecewise-Linear (CPWL) functions, exploiting this similarity
                     to design NN architectures with correctness guarantees has remained elusive. AReN
                     achieves this using two novel features. First, we reinterpret a recent result about
                     the implementation of CPWL functions via ReLU NNs to show that a CPWL function may
                     be implemented by a ReLU architecture that is determined by the number of distinct
                     affine regions in the function. Second, we show that we can efficiently over-approximate
                     the number of affine regions in the optimal MPC controller without solving the MPC
                     problem exactly. Together, these results connect the MPC problem to a ReLU NN implementation
                     without explicitly solving the MPC: the result is a NN architecture that has the assurance
                     that it can implement the MPC controller. We show through numerical results the effectiveness
                     of AReN in designing an NN architecture.

                  <p>Runtime monitoring is commonly used to detect the violation of desired properties
                     in safety critical cyber-physical systems by observing its executions. Bauer et al.
                     introduced an influential framework for monitoring Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties
                     based on a three-valued semantics: the formula is already satisfied by the given prefix,
                     it is already violated, or it is still undetermined, i.e., it can still be satisfied
                     and violated by appropriate extensions. However, a wide range of formulas are not
                     monitorable under this approach, meaning that they have a prefix for which satisfaction
                     and violation will always remain undetermined no matter how it is extended. In particular,
                     Bauer et al. report that 44% of the formulas they consider in their experiments fall
                     into this category.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Recently, a robust semantics for LTL was introduced to capture different degrees by
                     wich a property can be violated. In this paper we introduce a robust semantics for
                     finite strings and show its potential in monitoring: every formula considered by Bauer
                     et al. is monitorable under our approach. Furthermore, we discuss which properties
                     that come naturally in LTL monitoring --- such as the realizability of all truth values
                     --- can be transferred to the robust setting. Lastly, we show that LTL formulas with
                     robust semantics can be monitored by deterministic automata and report on a prototype
                     implementation.

                  <p>In this paper, we introduce tools to verify the satisfaction of temporal logic specifications
                     using the until operator for hybrid dynamical systems. Hybrid dynamical systems are
                     given in terms of differential and difference inclusions, which capture the continuous
                     and discrete dynamics (or events), respectively. For such systems, conditional invariance
                     and eventual conditional invariance are employed to characterize dynamical properties
                     associated with the until operators. Sufficient conditions for the satisfaction of
                     temporal logic specifications involving the until operator are provided by guaranteeing
                     properties of the data defining the systems and the existence of barrier functions
                     or Lyapunov-like functions. Examples illustrate the results throughout the paper.

                  <p>Cyber-physical system applications such as autonomous vehicles, wearable devices,
                     and avionic systems generate a large volume of time-series data. Designers often look
                     for tools to help classify and categorize the data. Traditional machine learning techniques
                     for time-series data offer several solutions to solve these problems; however, the
                     artifacts trained by these algorithms often lack interpretability. On the other hand,
                     temporal logic, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) have been successfully used in
                     the formal methods community as specifications of time-series behaviors. In this work,
                     we propose a new technique to automatically learn temporal logic formulas that are
                     able to classify real-valued time-series data. Previous work on learning STL formulas
                     from data either assumes a formula-template to be given by the user, or assumes some
                     special fragment of STL that enables exploring the formula structure in a systematic
                     fashion. In our technique, we relax these assumptions, and provide a way to systematically
                     explore the space of all STL formulas. As the space of all STL formulas is very large,
                     and contains many semantically equivalent formulas, we suggest a technique to heuristically
                     prune the space of formulas considered. Finally, we illustrate our technique on various
                     case studies from the automotive and transportation domains.

                  <p>Nondeterminism occurs naturally in Petri nets whenever multiple events are enabled
                     at the same time. Traditionally, it is resolved at specification time using probability
                     weights and priorities. In this paper, we focus on model checking for hybrid Petri
                     nets with an arbitrary but finite number of stochastic firings (HPnGs) while preserving
                     the inherent nondeterminism as a first-class modelling and analysis feature. We present
                     two algorithms to compute optimal <em>non-prophetic</em> and <em>prophetic</em> schedulers. The former can be applied to all HPnG models while the latter is only
                     applicable if information on the firing times of general transitions is specifically
                     encoded in the model. Both algorithms make use of recent work on the parametric location
                     tree, which symbolically unfolds the state space of an HPnG. A running example illustrates
                     the approach and confirms the feasibility of the presented algorithm.

                  <p>For exhaustive formal verification, industrial-scale <em>cyber-physical systems (CPSs)</em> are often too large and complex, and lightweight alternatives (e.g., monitoring and
                     testing) have attracted the attention of both industrial practitioners and academic
                     researchers. <em>Falsification</em> is one popular testing method of CPSs utilizing <em>stochastic optimization.</em> In state-of-the-art falsification methods, the result of the previous falsification
                     trials is discarded, and we always try to falsify without any prior knowledge. To
                     concisely memorize such prior information on the CPS model and exploit it, we employ
                     <em>Black-box checking (BBC)</em>, which is a combination of <em>automata learning</em> and <em>model checking.</em> Moreover, we enhance BBC using the <em>robust semantics</em> of STL formulas, which is the essential gadget in falsification. Our experiment results
                     suggest that our robustness-guided BBC outperforms a state-of-the-art falsification

                  <p>The use of Neural Network (NN)-based controllers has attracted significant attention
                     in recent years. Yet, due to the complexity and non-linearity of such NN-based cyber-physical
                     systems (CPS), existing verification techniques that employ exhaustive state-space
                     search, face significant scalability challenges; this effectively limits their use
                     for analysis of real-world CPS. In this work, we focus on the use of Statistical Model
                     Checking (SMC) for verifying complex NN-controlled CPS. Using an SMC approach based
                     on Clopper-Pearson confidence levels, we verify from samples specifications that are
                     captured by Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas. Specifically, we consider three
                     CPS benchmarks with varying levels of plant and controller complexity, as well as
                     the type of considered STL properties - reachability property for a mountain car,
                     safety property for a bipedal robot, and control performance of the closed-loop magnet
                     levitation system. On these benchmarks, we show that SMC methods can be successfully
                     used to provide high-assurance for learning-based CPS.

                  <p>Neural networks present a useful framework for learning complex dynamics, and are
                     increasingly being considered as components to closed loop predictive control algorithms.
                     However, if they are to be utilized in such safety-critical advisory settings, they
                     must be provably "conformant" to the governing scientific (biological, chemical, physical)
                     laws which underlie the modeled process. Unfortunately, this is not easily guaranteed
                     as neural network models are prone to learn patterns which are artifacts of the conditions
                     under which the training data is collected, which may not necessarily conform to underlying
                     physiological laws.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In this work, we utilize a formal range-propagation based approach for checking whether
                     neural network models for predicting future blood glucose levels of individuals with
                     type-1 diabetes are monotonic in terms of their insulin inputs. These networks are
                     increasingly part of closed loop predictive control algorithms for "artificial pancreas"
                     devices which automate control of insulin delivery for individuals with type-1 diabetes.
                     Our approach considers a key property that blood glucose levels must be monotonically
                     decreasing with increasing insulin inputs to the model. Multiple representative neural
                     network models for blood glucose prediction are trained and tested on real patient
                     data, and conformance is tested through our verification approach. We observe that
                     standard approaches to training networks result in models which violate the core relationship
                     between insulin inputs and glucose levels, despite having high prediction accuracy.
                     We propose an approach that can learn conformant models without much loss in accuracy.

                  <p>We consider the policy synthesis problem for continuous-state controlled Markov processes
                     evolving in discrete time, when the specification is given as a Büchi condition (visit
                     a set of states infinitely often). We decompose computation of the maximal probability
                     of satisfying the Büchi condition into two steps. The first step is to compute the
                     maximal <em>qualitative winning set</em>, from where the Büchi condition can be enforced with probability one. The second
                     step is to find the maximal probability of reaching the already computed qualitative
                     winning set. In contrast with finite-state models, we show that such a computation
                     only gives a lower bound on the maximal probability where the gap can be non-zero.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In this paper we focus on approximating the qualitative winning set, while pointing
                     out that the existing approaches for unbounded reachability computation can solve
                     the second step. We provide an abstraction-based technique to approximate the qualitative
                     winning set by simultaneously using an over- and under-approximation of the probabilistic
                     transition relation. Since we are interested in qualitative properties, the abstraction
                     is non-probabilistic; instead, the probabilistic transitions are assumed to be under
                     the control of a (fair) adversary. Thus, we reduce the original policy synthesis problem
                     to a Büchi game under a fairness assumption and characterize upper and lower bounds
                     on winning sets as nested fixed point expressions in the μ-calculus. This characterization
                     immediately provides a symbolic algorithm scheme. Further, a winning strategy computed
                     on the abstract game can be refined to a policy on the controlled Markov process.
                  </p> 
                  <p>We describe a concrete abstraction procedure and demonstrate our algorithm on two
                     case studies. We show that our techniques are able to provide tight approximations
                     to the qualitative winning set for the Van der Pol oscillator and a 3-d Dubins' vehicle.

                  <p>We consider abstraction-based design of <em>output-feedback</em> controllers for dynamical systems with a finite set of inputs and outputs against
                     specifications in linear-time temporal logic. The usual procedure for abstraction-based
                     controller design (ABCD) first constructs a <em>finite-state</em> abstraction of the underlying dynamical system, and second, uses reactive synthesis
                     techniques to compute an abstract <em>state-feedback</em> controller on the abstraction. In this context, our contribution is two-fold: (I)
                     we define a suitable relation between the original system and its abstraction which
                     characterizes the soundness and completeness conditions for an abstract <em>state-feedback</em> controller to be refined to a concrete <em>output-feedback</em> controller for the original system, and (II) we provide an algorithm to compute a
                     <em>sound finite-state abstraction</em> fulfilling this relation.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Our relation generalizes feedback-refinement relations from ABCD with state-feedback.
                     Our algorithm for constructing sound finite-state abstractions is inspired by the
                     simultaneous reachability and bisimulation minimization algorithm of Lee and Yannakakis.
                     We lift their idea to the computation of an observation-equivalent system and show
                     how <em>sound abstractions</em> can be obtained by stopping this algorithm at any point. Additionally, our new algorithm
                     produces a realization of the topological closure of the input/output behavior of
                     the original system if it is finite-state realizable.

                  <p>We develop an assume-guarantee framework for control of large scale linear (time-varying)
                     systems from finite-time reach and avoid or infinite-time invariance specifications.
                     The contracts describe the admissible set of states and controls for individual subsystems.
                     A set of contracts compose correctly if mutual assumptions and guarantees match in
                     a way that we formalize. We propose a rich parameterization of contracts such that
                     the set of parameters that compose correctly is convex. Moreover, we design a potential
                     function of parameters that describes the distance of contracts from a correct composition.
                     Thus, the verification and synthesis for the aggregate system are broken to solving
                     small convex programs for individual subsystems, where correctness is ultimately achieved
                     in a compositional way. Illustrative examples demonstrate the scalability of our method.

                  <p>Decision tree learning is a popular classification technique most commonly used in
                     machine learning applications. Recent work has shown that decision trees can be used
                     to represent provably-correct controllers concisely. Compared to representations using
                     lookup tables or binary decision diagrams, decision trees are smaller and more explainable.
                     We present dtControl, an easily extensible tool for representing memoryless controllers
                     as decision trees. We give a comprehensive evaluation of various decision tree learning
                     algorithms applied to 10 case studies arising out of correct-by-construction controller
                     synthesis. These algorithms include two new techniques, one for using arbitrary linear
                     binary classifiers in the decision tree learning, and one novel approach for determinizing
                     controllers during the decision tree construction. In particular the latter turns
                     out to be extremely efficient, yielding decision trees with a single-digit number
                     of decision nodes on 5 of the case studies.

                  <p>Hybrid Systems are systems having a mixed discrete and continuous behaviour that cannot
                     be characterized faithfully using either only discrete or only continuous models.
                     A good framework for hybrid systems should support their <em>compositional</em> description and analysis, since commonly systems are specified by a composition of
                     smaller subsystems, to cope with the complexity of their monolithic representation.
                     Moreover, since the reachability problem for hybrid systems is undecidable, one should
                     investigate the conditions that guarantee <em>approximate</em> computability of composition, when only approximations to the exact problem data

                  <p>In this paper, we propose an automata-based formalism (HIOA) for hybrid systems that
                     is compositional and for which the evolution can be computed approximately. The main
                     results are that the composition of compatible HIOA yields a pre-HIOA; a dominance
                     result on the composition of HIOA by which we can replace any component in a composition
                     by another one that exhibits the same external behaviour without affecting the behaviour
                     of the composition; finally, the key result that the composition of two compatible
                     upper(lower)-semicontinuous HIOA is a computable upper(lower)-semicontinuous pre-HIOA,
                     which entails that the evolution of the composition is upper(lower)-semicomputable.
                     A discussion on how compositionality/computability are handled in state-of-art libraries
                     for reachability analysis closes the paper.

                  <p>Whereas classical control theory provides many methods for designing continuous-time
                     feedback controllers, nowadays control algorithms are implemented on digital platforms
                     and have to be designed in sampled time. Approaches to sampled-time control design
                     are based on either discretization of the plant enabling discrete-time controller
                     synthesis, or various redesign methods converting a continuous-time controller into
                     a sampled-time approximation, providing comparable closed-loop system properties.
                     The simplest of redesign approaches, typically used in practice, is the <em>emulation</em> of continuous-time feedback by sufficiently fast sampling. In spite of its simplicity,
                     emulation gives rise to an important problem: does emulation at a sufficiently high
                     rate (or, equivalently, with a small sampling time) preserve the stability of the
                     closed-loop system? In this paper, we address this problem for the case of <em>exponential</em> stability (local or global). Even for linear systems, the problem of stability preservation
                     becomes non-trivial when sampling is aperiodic. For nonlinear systems, viability of
                     emulation approach is usually proved only under quite restrictive assumptions on the
                     plant and the controller, which, as will be shown, in fact be discarded.

                  <p>Modeling languages and tools based on Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE) bring
                     several specific issues that do not exist with modeling languages based on Ordinary
                     Differential Equations. The main problem is the determination of the differentiation
                     index and latent equations. Prior to generating simulation code and calling solvers,
                     the compilation of a model requires a structural analysis step, which reduces the
                     differentiation index to a level acceptable by numerical solvers.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The Modelica language, among others, allows hybrid models with multiple modes, mode-dependent
                     dynamics and state-dependent mode switching. These Multimode DAE (mDAE) systems are
                     much harder to deal with. The main difficulties are (i) the combinatorial explosion
                     of the number of modes, and (ii) the correct handling of mode switchings.
                  </p> 
                  <p>The focus of this paper is on the first issue, namely: How can one perform a structural
                     analysis of an mDAE in all possible modes, without enumerating these modes? A structural
                     analysis algorithm for mDAE systems is presented, based on an implicit representation
                     of their varying structure. It generalizes J. Pryce's Σ-method to the multimode case
                     and uses Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) to represent the mode-dependent structure
                     of an mDAE. The algorithm determines, as a function of the mode, the set of latent
                     equations, the leading variables and the state vector. This is then used to compute
                     a conditional block dependency graph of the system, that can be used to generate efficient
                     simulation code with a mode-dependent scheduling of the blocks of equations.

                  <p>Motivated by the safety problem, several definitions of reachability maps, for hybrid
                     dynamical systems, are introduced. It is well established that, under certain conditions,
                     the solutions to continuous-time systems depend continuously with respect to initial
                     conditions. In such setting, the reachability maps considered in this paper are locally
                     Lipschitz (in the Lipschitz sense for set-valued maps) when the right-hand side of
                     the continuous-time system is locally Lipschitz. However, guaranteeing similar properties
                     for reachability maps for hybrid systems is much more challenging. Examples of hybrid
                     systems for which the reachability maps do not depend nicely with respect to their
                     arguments, in the Lipschitz sense, are introduced. With such pathological cases properly
                     identified, sufficient conditions involving the data defining a hybrid system assuring
                     Lipschitzness of the reachability maps are formulated. As an application, the proposed
                     conditions are shown to be useful to significantly improve an existing converse theorem
                     for safety given in terms of barrier functions. Namely, for a class of safe hybrid
                     systems, we show that safety is equivalent to the existence of a locally Lipschitz
                     barrier function. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.

                  <p>In this paper, we provide a compositional framework for synthesizing hybrid controllers
                     for interconnected discrete-time control systems enforcing specifications expressed
                     by co-Büchi automata. In particular, we first decompose the given specification to
                     simpler reachability tasks based on automata representing the complements of original
                     co-Büchi automata. Then, we provide a systematic approach to solve those simpler reachability
                     tasks by computing cor-responding control barrier functions. We show that such control
                     barrier functions can be constructed compositionally by assuming some small-gain type
                     conditions and composing so-called local control barrier functions computed for subsystems.
                     We provide two systematic techniques to search for local control barrier functions
                     for subsystems based on the sum-of-squares optimization program and counter-example

                  <p>In this paper we revisit the problem of computing controlled invariant sets for controllable
                     discrete-time linear systems and present a novel hierarchy for their computation.
                     The key insight is to lift the problem to a higher dimensional space where the maximal
                     controlled invariant set can be computed exactly and in closed-form for the lifted
                     system. By projecting this set into the original space we obtain a controlled invariant
                     set that is a subset of the maximal controlled invariant set for the original system.
                     Building upon this insight we describe in this paper a hierarchy of spaces where the
                     original problem can be lifted into so as to obtain a sequence of increasing controlled
                     invariant sets. The algorithm that results from the proposed hierarchy does not rely
                     on iterative computations. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method on
                     a variety of scenarios exemplifying its appeal.

                  <p>We propose a method to control linear time-varying (LTV) discrete-time systems subject
                     to bounded process disturbances and measurable outputs with bounded noise, and polyhedral
                     constraints over system inputs and states. We search over control policies that map
                     the history of measurable outputs to the current control input. We solve the problem
                     in two stages. First, using the original system, we build a linear system that predicts
                     future observations using the past observations. The bounded errors are characterized
                     using zonotopes. Next, we propose control laws based on affine maps of such output
                     prediction errors, and show that controllers can be synthesized using convex linear/quadratic
                     programs. Furthermore, we can add constraints on trajectories and guarantee their
                     satisfaction for all allowable sequences of observation noise and process disturbances.
                     Our method does not require any assumptions about system controllability and observability.
                     The controller design does not directly take into account the state-space dynamics,
                     and its implementation does not require an observer. Instead, partial observability
                     is often sufficient to design a correct controller. We provide the polytopic representation
                     of observability errors and reachable sets in the form of zonotopes. Illustrative
                     examples are included.

                  <p>This paper presents an approach of safety verification based on neural networks for
                     continuous dynamical systems which are modeled as a system of ordinary differential
                     equations. We adopt the deductive verification methods based on barrier certificates.
                     These are functions over the states of the dynamical system with certain constraints
                     the existence of which entails the safety of the system under consideration. We propose
                     to represent the barrier function by neural networks and provide a comprehensive synthesis
                     framework. In particular, we devise a new type of activation functions, i.e., Bent-ReLU,
                     for the neural networks; we provide sampling based approaches to generate training
                     sets and formulate the loss functions for neural network training which can capture
                     the essence of barrier certificate; we also present practical methods to check a learnt
                     candidate barrier certificate against the criteria of barrier certificates as a formal
                     guarantee. We implement our approaches via proof-of-concept experiments with encouraging

                  <p>We consider the pressing question of how to model, verify, and ensure that autonomous
                     systems meet certain <em>obligations</em> (like the obligation to respect traffic laws), and refrain from impermissible behavior
                     (like recklessly changing lanes). Temporal logics are heavily used in autonomous system
                     design; however, as we illustrate here, temporal (alethic) logics alone are inappropriate
                     for reasoning about obligations of autonomous systems. This paper proposes the use
                     of Dominance Act Utilitarianism (DAU), a deontic logic of agency, to encode and reason
                     about obligations of autonomous systems. We use DAU to analyze Intel's Responsibility-Sensitive
                     Safety (RSS) proposal as a real-world case study. We demonstrate that DAU can express
                     well-posed RSS rules, formally derive undesirable consequences of these rules, illustrate
                     how DAU could help design systems that have specific obligations, and how to model-check
                     DAU obligations.

                  <p>Many vehicle accidents result from collision with foreign objects. Automatic and provably
                     safe collision avoidance systems are thus of prime importance to the automobile industry.
                     Previous work on formally verifying car collision avoidance maneuvers typically only
                     focuses on braking-only or swerving-only maneuvers. In this work, we study combined
                     braking and swerving maneuvers and establish formally verified conditions under which
                     safety from collision is ensured. One major constrain in performing such joint maneuvers
                     is that a vehicle's tires have limited traction which can be used either for braking
                     or swerving. So in essence, a combined maneuver can trade off braking ability for
                     turning when it is advantageous to do so and vice-versa. In this work, we study the
                     full continuous range of combined maneuvers, from maximal turning with little braking
                     to maximal braking with little turning.
                  </p> 
                  <p>We use a unicycle model with Ackermann's steering for the car's motion, and the circle
                     of traction forces to model the trade-off between braking and swerving. Resulting
                     vehicle kinematics are formulated as a hybrid program in <em>differential dynamic logic</em> d<em>L</em>. We use the automated theorem prover KeYmaera X to formally verify the correctness
                     of the collision avoidance property. This verification provides a mathematical guarantee
                     that a given maneuver can prevent the car from collision with obstacles under certain
                     conditions. The employed method is generic with a purely symbolic model and, thus,
                     can be applied to verify other types of collision avoidance systems exhibiting richer
                     behaviour.

                  <p>This paper describes a verification case study on an autonomous racing car with a
                     neural network (NN) controller. Although several verification approaches have been
                     recently proposed, they have only been evaluated on low-dimensional systems or systems
                     with constrained environments. To explore the limits of existing approaches, we present
                     a challenging benchmark in which the NN takes raw LiDAR measurements as input and
                     outputs steering for the car. We train a dozen NNs using reinforcement learning (RL)
                     and show that the state of the art in verification can handle systems with around
                     40 LiDAR rays. Furthermore, we perform real experiments to investigate the benefits
                     and limitations of verification with respect to the sim2real gap, i.e., the difference
                     between a system's modeled and real performance. We identify cases, similar to the
                     modeled environment, in which verification is strongly correlated with safe behavior.
                     Finally, we illustrate LiDAR fault patterns that can be used to develop robust and
                     safe RL algorithms.

                  <p>Ant Colony algorithms are a set of biologically inspired algorithms used commonly
                     to solve distributed optimization problems. Convergence has been proven in the context
                     of optimization processes, but these proofs are not applicable in the framework of
                     robotic control. In order to use Ant Colony algorithms to control robotic swarms,
                     we present in this work more general results that prove asymptotic convergence of

                  <p>Decision tree learning is a popular classification technique most commonly used in
                     machine learning applications. Recent work has shown that decision trees can be used
                     to represent provably-correct controllers concisely. Compared to representations using
                     lookup tables or binary decision diagrams, decision tree representations are smaller
                     and more explainable. We present dtControl, an easily extensible tool offering a wide
                     variety of algorithms for representing memoryless controllers as decision trees. We
                     highlight that the trees produced by dtControl are often very concise with a single-digit
                     number of decision nodes. This demo is based on our tool paper [1].

                  <p>Large-scale stochastic systems have recently received significant attentions due to
                     their broad applications in various safety-critical systems such as <em>traffic networks</em> and <em>self-driving cars.</em> In this poster, we describe the software tool AMYTISS, implemented in C++/OpenCL,
                     for designing correct-by-construction controllers for large-scale discrete-time stochastic
                     systems. This tool is employed to (i) build <em>finite</em> Markov decision processes (MDPs) as finite abstractions of given original systems,
                     and (ii) synthesize controllers for the constructed finite MDPs satisfying bounded-time
                     safety, reachability, and reach-avoid specifications. In AMYTISS, scalable parallel
                     algorithms are designed such that they support the parallel execution within CPUs,
                     GPUs and hardware accelerators (HWAs). Unlike all existing tools for stochastic systems,
                     AMYTISS can utilize high-performance computing (HPC) platforms and cloud-computing
                     services to mitigate the effects of the state-explosion problem, which is always present
                     in analyzing large-scale stochastic systems. We benchmark AMYTISS against the most
                     recent tools in the literature using several physical case studies including robot
                     examples, room temperature and road traffic networks. We also apply our algorithms
                     to a 3-dimensional autonomous vehicle and a 7-dimensional <em>nonlinear</em> model of a BMW 320i car by synthesizing autonomous parking controllers.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Related works. There exist a limited number of software tools on the verification and synthesis
                     of stochastic systems with different classes of models. SReachTools [1] performs the
                     stochastic reachability analysis for linear, potentially time-varying, discrete-time
                     stochastic systems. FAUST<sup>2</sup> [2] generates formal abstractions for continuous-space discrete-time stochastic processes,
                     and performs the verification and synthesis for safety and reachability specifications.
                     However, FAUST<sup>2</sup> is originally implemented in MATLAB and handles finite-horizon specifications. StocHy
                     [3] deals with a class of discrete-time stochastic hybrid systems, constructs finite
                     abstractions, and performs the verification and synthesis for both finite- and infinite-horizon
                     safety and reachability specifications. AMYTISS differs from FAUST<sup>2</sup> and StocHy in two main directions. First, AMYTISS implements novel parallel algorithms
                     and data structures targeting HPC platforms to reduce the undesirable effects of the
                     state-explosion problem. Accordingly, it is able to perform the parallel execution
                     in different heterogeneous computing platforms including CPUs, GPUs and hardware accelerators
                     (HWAs). Whereas, FAUST<sup>2</sup> and StocHy can only run serially in one CPU, and consequently, they are limited to
                     small systems. Additionally, AMYTISS can handle the abstraction construction and controller
                     synthesis for two and a halfplayer games (e.g., stochastic systems with bounded disturbances),
                     whereas FAUST<sup>2</sup> and StocHy only handle one and a halfplayer games (disturbance-free systems).
                  </p> 
                  <p>Unlike all existing tools, AMYTISS offers highly scalable, distributed execution of
                     parallel algorithms utilizing all available processing elements (PEs) in any heterogeneous
                     computing platform. To the best of our knowledge, AMYTISS is the only tool of its
                     kind for continuous-space stochastic systems that is able to utilize simultaneously
                     all types of compute units (CUs).
                  </p> 
                  <p>A comparison between AMYTISS, FAUST<sup>2</sup> and StocHy based on their native features is provide in Table 1.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Main Contribution. AMYTISS is an <em>open-source</em> and self-contained tool and requires only a modern C++ compiler. It supports three
                     major operating systems: Windows, Linux and Mac OS. The source of AMYTISS and detailed

                  <p>The main merits of this work are:</p> 
                  <p>(1) We propose a novel data-parallel algorithm for constructing finite MDPs from discrete-time
                     stochastic systems and storing them in efficient distributed data containers.
                  </p> 
                  <p>(2) We propose parallel algorithms for synthesizing discrete controllers using the
                     constructed MDPs to satisfy safety, reachability, or reach-avoid specifications. More
                     specifically, we introduce novel parallel algorithms for the iterative computation
                     of Bellman equation in the standard dynamic programming [4].
                  </p> 
                  <p>(3) Unlike the existing tools in the literature, AMYTISS accepts bounded disturbances
                     and natively supports both additive and multiplicative noises with different distributions
                     including normal, uniform, exponential, and beta.

                  <p>This paper introduces inter-triggering hybrid automata, a formalism to represent multi-agent
                     systems where each agent is represented as a hybrid automaton and agents interact
                     by triggering discrete transitions (jumps and resets) on their "neighboring" agents.
                     Using this formalism, we define responsibility-sensitive safety as respecting one
                     another's invariances while triggering jumps and resets. This allows us to make a
                     formal connection between responsibility and robust controlled invariant sets for
                     individual agents, therefore leading to a compositional verification framework for
                     the safety of the overall multi-agent system. We discuss several advantages of this
                     viewpoint and illustrate it on a highway driving example.

                  <p>We consider the computation of resilient controllers for perturbed non-linear dynamical
                     systems w.r.t. linear-time temporal logic specifications. We address this problem
                     through the paradigm of Abstraction-Based Controller Design (ABCD) where a finite
                     state abstraction of the perturbed system dynamics is constructed and utilized for
                     controller synthesis. In this context, our contribution is twofold: (I) We construct
                     abstractions which model the impact of occasional high disturbance spikes on the system
                     via the so called disturbance edges. (II) We show that the application of resilient
                     reactive synthesis techniques to these abstract models results in controllers which
                     render the resulting closed loop system maximally resilient to these occasional high
                     disturbance spikes. We have implemented this resilient ABCD workflow on top of SCOTS
                     and showcase our method through multiple robot planning examples.
