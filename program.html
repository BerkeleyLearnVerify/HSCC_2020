            <h3><strong>Title:</strong> Safe Autonomy with Deep Learning in Feedback Loop</h3>

            <blockquote><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                Deep learning has been extremely successful in
                computer vision and perception.  Inspired by this
                success in perceiving environments, deep learning is
                now one of the main sensing modalities in autonomous
                robots, including driverless cars.  The recent success
                of deep reinforcement learning in chess or AlphaGo
                suggests that robot planning control will soon be
                performed by deep learning in a model free manner,
                disrupting traditional model-based engineering design.
                However, recent crashes in driverless cars as well as
                adversarial attacks in deep networks have exposed the
                brittleness of deep learning perception which then
                leads to catastrophic decisions.  There is a
                tremendous opportunity for the cyber physical systems
                community to embrace these challenges and develop
                principles, architectures, and tools to ensure safety
                of autonomous systems.
                </br></br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this talk, I will present our
                approach in ensuring the robustness and safety of
                autonomous robots that use deep learning as a
                perceptual sensor in the feedback loop. Using ideas
                from robust control, we develop tools to analyze the
                robustness of deep networks that ensure that the
                perception of the environment is more
                accurate. Critical to our approach is creating
                semantic representations of unknown environments while
                also quantifying the uncertainty of semantic
                maps. Autonomous planning and control need to both
                embrace such semantic representations and formally
                reason about the environment uncertainty produced by
                deep learning the feedback loop, leading to autonomous
                robots that operate with prescribed safely in unknown
                but learned environments.

            <h3><strong>Title:</strong>
                Human-CPS through the Lens of Learning and Control
            </h3>

            <blockquote><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                Machine learning and control theory have made substantial advances in
                the field of cyber-physical systems and robotics in the past
                decade. However, there are still many challenges remaining when
                studying cyber-physical systems that interact with humans, i.e.,
                human-CPS. This includes autonomous vehicles that interact with
                people, service robots working with their users at homes, assistive
                robots helping disabled bodies, or humans interacting with drones or
                other autonomous agents in their daily lives. These challenges
                introduce an opportunity for developing new learning and control
                algorithms to enable safe and efficient interactive autonomy.
                </br></br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this talk, I will discuss a
                journey in formalizing human-CPS
                interaction. Specifically, I will first discuss
                developing data-efficient techniques to learn
                computational models of human behavior. I will
                continue with the challenges that arise when agents
                (including humans and robots) interact with each
                other. Further, I will argue that in many
                applications, a full computational human model is not
                necessary for seamless and efficient
                interaction. Instead, in many collaborative tasks,
                conventions —low-dimensional shared representations of
                tasks — is sufficient for capturing the interaction
                between agents. I will conclude the talk with
                challenges around adapting conventions in human-robot
                applications such as assistive teleoperation and
                collaborative transport.
