        <h1>HSCC 2020 - Double Blind Review Process</h1>

        <br>
        HSCC 2019 will employ light double-blind reviewing. <br>

        <br>Submitted papers must adhere to two rules:<br>
        <ul>
            <li> author names and institutions must be omitted, and
                <li> references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).
        </ul>

        <br>The purpose of this process is to help the program committee come to an
        initial judgment about the paper without bias, it is not to make it
        impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing
        should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or
        makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important
        background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition,
        authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions
        of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post
        drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.<br>

        following during the review process can be found <a
